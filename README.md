# sublime theme maker

* setup with `bundle`

* run with `be mustache light.yml itg.flat.light.mustache >! itg.flat.light.sublime-theme`


## Explain-a-nator

This is the bare bones, first implementation of using mustache to generate sublime-themes.
As I continue, this will become much more automated.

The Goal: Changing variables in YAML files will allow you to quickly change the colors
for your theme, and allow you to produce multiple color schemes, very quickly.
